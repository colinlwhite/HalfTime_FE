# HalfTime

This is my Full Stack Capstone Project for Nashville Software School. HalfTime is an application for band directors to manage and track the programâ€™s students, instruments, uniforms and events. The application was made with React and various components to enhance the experience. Twilio's API allows the primary user to send SMS messages to volunteers about upcoming events. Other technologies include C# and .NET.
